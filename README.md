# Actapp - Basketball tournament manager 
### Computer Science Bachelor's Final Thesis
### University of Granada, 2020

The main goal of this project is to design and develop a **web application for managing and displaying basketball
competitions** with a flexible approach, trying to avoid the current chaos we can find in our country (Spain)
about this sport:

- **Data and systems not shared between different federations**. Our country has a federation per Autonomous Community 
with private data and different ways to manage the same type of information. 
- **Unreadable referee game reports**. Unlike other sports such as football, the old format based on paper is very 
difficult to read unless you have technical knowledge of basketball. All events existing in a game for instance, the 
number of points a player has scored or faults that he/she committed are in a difficult paper format. 
- **Itâ€™s not user-friendly**. All information is difficult to understand, old fashion and with a poor user experience. 

This web application will help you to understand what happened or is happening in a game, see a digital version of the 
referee game report, being able to download a printable document of that report in a PDF file format. All existing 
information will be shown with a great user interface and awesome user experience, making them readable by everyone. 

In order to manage games, we need to manage competitions. So, this system will be flexible enough to take into account 
all possible needs we can find in a basketball game:

- **Competition mode**. You will be able to create a tournament taking into account all possible competition modes 
existing in this sport: league, cup or playoffs, and regular season and then playoffs. Thanks to the flexible approach, 
we can also set some competition configurations, like minimum number of players per team or number of games per playoff
round, among others. 
- **Number of players per game**. We need to be aware that basketball is a sport not tied to a specific number of 
players in each team, they must be equally but the number of players can vary. So, this platform will allow you to 
configure games with different number of players per team (5 on 5, 3 on 3, etc.). 

As consequence, this platform will also help you to manage players and teams that can participate in competitions, 
generate automatically all different fixtures for you, calculate standings of a league, display and set game schedules, 
view game results, and also, statistics based on a player, a team and players or teams in a specific competition, 
allowing you to follow some player or team development along years. 

All these features will be able to be displayed in **any device**. It doesn't matter the screen size of the device you 
are using, the content will be adapted either a personal computer, a tablet, a smartphone or even a TV. 

All the information existing in the system will be available and visible for everyone. However, all these events 
existing in a game will be logged by administrators thanks to a new accessible method of data input easy to use. The 
administrators are the only registered users existing in this application, and they are the only ones that can input 
data into the system. Administrators are also responsible for managing players, teams and competitions.

Also, data will always be updated, so you're able to view events that happened in a past game or what is happening **in 
live**.
